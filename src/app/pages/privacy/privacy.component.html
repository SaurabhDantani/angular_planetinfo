      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and

      force majeure events, etc. Hence, the technical and organizational

      on behalf of which we collected the data. Subject to applicable law, the
      Personal Information so collected through the Applications is retained
      only for as long as necessary to follow our customersâ€™ instructions or
      to comply with legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements. For eg.
      in case any of the customers use the face recognition feature (which is
      used to identify if the vehicleâ€™s assigned driver matches the person who
      is driving), subject to the customer instructions and applicable law, the
      data is used purely for identification and stored only as long as the
      driver is active in the system. We automatically purge the face data as
      soon as the driver exits the system. You may further connect with the
      relevant customer for more information about their data retention and
